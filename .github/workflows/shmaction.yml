# simulate a test that we figure good/bad on based on grepping output (and pass/fail based on exit code of grep). 
# but we also want to _see_ the output in the action, so we know why we're failing. this proves a bit challenging.
# example use is rubocop report which will print fail details vs. a certain string if NO fails.
